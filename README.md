## Description

Based on the [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) starter repository.
Leverages [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) 
Leverages [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) 
Leverages [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) kinda 
Based on Entities from [Bloom](https://github.com/bloom-housing/bloom)

This is a PoC/experiment to test a few different ORMs with how Bloom set up its entities. 
This for sure could use some clean up, but the query meta data should still stay relevent.

There are a few different endpoints all listed out in the app.controller.ts file. Inside that file you'll find the different URLs.
My recommendation is to hit the `_validate_` endpoints since that includes meta data, and doesn't clog things up with actually trying to render what could be a ton of text.
You can hit this using a tool like postman, or just throwing the commented URLs into a browser.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```
make sure the .env file's db placement is what you're looking for
```bash
$ yarn typeorm:setup
$ yarn prisma:setup
$ yarn sequelize:setup
```
Hit http://localhost:3000/typeorm_seeding & http://localhost:3000/prisma_seeding to seed starting data after you have started the app

## Running the app

```bash
$ yarn start
```

## Sequelize

Sequelize seems to want people to create the models/migrations from the cli which doesn't seem ideal for more complex models

I ended up dropping Sequelize investigation for this because of its lack of migrations based off of models instead of doing it all through the cli.
